# LanguageApp_ITEC4012_Final
 - How to set up this project:

    * Make sure you have npm, react and bootstrap installed.
    * Run the frontend in the terminal: npm start
  
 - Frontend:
    * View frontend in the browser: http://localhost:3000
      1. Sign in Page: You can log in with a username and password and when you click the sign in button it brings you to the dashboard page.
      2. Dashboard: You can choose from one of the different options -> Lessons, Quizzes or Progress. You can also sign out by clicking the sign out button.
      3. Lessons: Just text in Spanish here.
      4. Quizzes: *From feedback received from Backend Deliverable:*
         - Before: you could only select one answer throughtout the whole quiz and when you click the submit button the answer disapears.
         - Now: you can select one answer per quiz question. Multiple answers in the whole quiz page, but one answer per question (hope this make sense?).
                Also, when you click the submit button now, it gives the user feedback on what their answers were. So the answers don't just disappear.
      6. Progress: Has the number of lessons completed by the user as well as the the score they received from the quiz.
                   There's also a progress bar indicating their progress so far.

 - Miscellaneous features:
      1. Use of breadcrumbs.
      2. User receives feedback when submitting something on the app (not sure if this counts)
  
 - Bonus points:
      1. GORGEOUS DESIGN!: Clean design, pretty use of colours and nice UI elements. Easy to read and clean fonts. Also I have cute images.
